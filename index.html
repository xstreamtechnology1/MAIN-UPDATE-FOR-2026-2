                                <p>Jesus Teaches Nicodemus — A Deep Teaching on Spiritual Birth

                                Nicodemus was a Pharisee, a respected teacher of the law, and a member of the Sanhedrin—Israel’s highest religious council. Though learned and influential, he sensed there was something missing in his spiritual life. He saw the miracles of Jesus and recognized divine power at work.

                                Scripture:

                                “There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night…”
                                — John 3:1–2

                                Nicodemus came at night, possibly out of fear, but also seeking clarity. He respectfully acknowledged Jesus:

                                “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God…”
                                — John 3:2

                                Jesus did not flatter him or answer his compliment. Instead, He went straight to the core of Nicodemus’ spiritual need.

                                1. Jesus Reveals the Mystery of Spiritual Birth

                                Jesus said:

                                “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”
                                — John 3:3

                                Nicodemus was shocked — how can a grown man be born a second time?

                                Jesus clarified:

                                “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”
                                — John 3:5

                                What does being born again mean?

                                Not a physical birth, but a spiritual transformation

                                A complete change of heart, mind, and character

                                A new beginning created by the Holy Spirit

                                The removal of the old sinful nature and adoption of God’s nature

                                Jesus continued:

                                “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
                                — John 3:6

                                The Spirit gives new life that human effort cannot produce.

                                2. Jesus Explains the Work of the Holy Spirit

                                Jesus compared the Spirit’s work to the wind:

                                “The wind blows where it wishes… so is everyone born of the Spirit.”
                                — John 3:8

                                The wind cannot be seen, but its effects are real.
                                Similarly, the Holy Spirit works invisibly but powerfully in the life of anyone who comes to God sincerely.

                                3. Jesus Reveals God’s Plan of Salvation

                                Nicodemus struggled to understand but Jesus gently pointed him to the heart of the gospel.

                                “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”
                                — John 3:14

                                This refers to Jesus being lifted on the cross.

                                Then Jesus spoke one of the most famous verses in Scripture:

                                “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son,
                                that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
                                — John 3:16

                                Jesus revealed that salvation is not by religion, laws, or human effort —
                                but by believing in Him and accepting His sacrifice.

                                4. Jesus Teaches About Light vs Darkness

                                Nicodemus came at night, symbolizing spiritual darkness.
                                Jesus explained why many reject the truth:

                                “Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.”
                                — John 3:19

                                Those who follow God move toward the light:

                                “He who practices the truth comes to the light.”
                                — John 3:21

                                Moral Lessons From Jesus and Nicodemus
                                1. A sincere heart attracts divine revelation

                                Nicodemus sought Jesus honestly, and Jesus revealed deep truths to him.

                                2. Religion is not salvation

                                Nicodemus was a religious leader but still needed to be born again.

                                3. Everyone needs spiritual rebirth

                                No one enters the kingdom of God by good works, knowledge, or church attendance — only by new birth through the Holy Spirit.

                                4. God’s love is for all

                                John 3:16 reveals that salvation is open to everyone who believes.

                                5. Light exposes the true condition of the heart

                                Those who love God move toward truth.
                                Those who cling to sin avoid the light.

                                6. Transformation shows true repentance

                                New birth produces:

                                new desires

                                new behaviors

                                new thinking

                                a new life in Christ

                                7. Seek God personally

                                Nicodemus met Jesus privately — sometimes you must seek God away from the noise and opinions of others.

                                2 Corinthians 5:17

                                “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature…”

                                Titus 3:5

                                “He saved us… by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.”

                                Romans 12:2

                                “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”

                                Ezekiel 36:26

                                “I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.”

                                Conclusion

                                The story of Nicodemus reminds us that God desires not just outward religion,
                                but a changed heart, a new life, and a relationship with Jesus.

                                Spiritual rebirth is the doorway to God’s kingdom, and it begins when we believe, repent, and surrender to Christ.</p>

                                </ul>

                                    <li>The Importance of the Bible — God’s Living Word

                                        The Bible is not an ordinary book. It is the inspired, authoritative Word of God that guides the believer in faith and daily living.

                                        1. The Bible Is Inspired by God

                                        “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God.” — 2 Timothy 3:16

                                        The Scriptures are God-breathed—divinely inspired and perfect for teaching, correction, and spiritual growth.

                                        2. The Bible Gives Direction

                                        In a world full of confusion, the Word of God shines as a lamp.

                                        “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105

                                        It guides decisions, relationships, character, and purpose.

                                        3. The Bible Builds Faith

                                        “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” — Romans 10:17

                                        Reading the Bible strengthens faith and helps believers stand firm in trials.

                                        4. The Bible Protects Us From Sin

                                        “Your word have I hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You.” — Psalm 119:11

                                        It empowers believers to resist temptation and live in holiness.

                                        5. The Bible Reveals God’s Plan

                                        The Scriptures show God’s plan of salvation, His promises, and His purpose for our lives.

                                        “The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever.” — Isaiah 40:8

                                        The Bible is eternal, unchanging, and always relevant.</li>

                            <h3>Understanding Salvation</h3>
                            <p class="excerpt">Salvation is the most important message in the entire Bible. It is God’s...</p>
                            <div class="full-content" style="display:none;">
                                <p>
                                     Salvation is the most important message in the entire Bible. It is God’s plan to rescue humanity from sin and restore us into a right relationship with Him through Jesus Christ.

                                    1. What Is Salvation?
                                    Salvation means being forgiven, cleansed, and reconciled back to God.
                                    The Bible says:
                                    “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23
                                    “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” — Romans 6:23
                                    Humanity was separated from God by sin, but God provided salvation through Christ.

                                    2. How Do We Receive Salvation?
                                    Salvation is not earned by good works, church attendance, or personal efforts. It is a free gift received by faith.
                                    “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved.” — Acts 16:31
                                    “If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.” — Romans 10:9
                                    We receive salvation by believing in Jesus, repenting of our sins, and accepting Him as Lord.

                                    3. Why Salvation Matters
                                    Salvation brings us:
                                    Eternal life
                                    Peace with God
                                    Freedom from guilt and condemnation
                                    Access to God’s promises
                                    A new identity in Christ
                                    “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.” — 2 Corinthians 5:17
                                    Salvation is not just about escaping hell; it is about living a transformed life today.

                <strong>Pastor’ Ambrose Elechi Alums is a dedicated servant of God, 
                    
                    </strong>passionate about spreading the Gospel and guiding others in their spiritual journey. With many years of ministry experience, he is known for his engaging sermons and ability to make Scripture relevant to everyday life.

                    <em>Committed to building a loving and united community,</em> Pastor Ambrose leads with humility, wisdom, and a heart for service. He has a special passion for specific focus, e.g., youth mentorship, family life, or missions, making heaven at last, working tirelessly to make a positive impact within and beyond the church.
                    
                    We are blessed to have Pastor Ambrose as our shepherd, alongside his wife Pst. Mrs Abigail Alum inspiring us to grow in faith and live out God’s love.
